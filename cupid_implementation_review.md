# CUPID Implementation Review

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive review of the CUPID (Curating Performance-Influencing Demonstrations) implementation, with specific focus on its integration with diffusion policies for the PushT task and compatibility with LeRobot standards.

## 1. Implementation Overview

### Core Components

#### 1.1 Influence Functions (`src/cupid/influence.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Correctly Implemented
- **Key Features**:
  - Trajectory-based influence computation following CUPID paper
  - Proper formula: `Ψ_inf(ξ) ≈ -∇_θ J(π_θ)^T H_bc^(-1) ∇_θ ℓ_traj(ξ)`
  - Diagonal Fisher Information Matrix approximation for scalability
  - REINFORCE-style performance gradient estimation
  - Damping factor: 1e-3 (appropriate for numerical stability)

#### 1.2 Diffusion Policy (`src/cupid/policy.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Well Implemented
- **Architecture**:
  - 1D U-Net with skip connections
  - Sinusoidal positional embeddings for diffusion timesteps
  - DDPM sampling process with 100 denoising steps
  - Hidden dimension: 256, Layers: 4
  - Proper noise scheduling (beta_start=1e-4, beta_end=2e-2)

#### 1.3 Training Pipeline (`src/cupid/trainer.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Properly Configured
- **Parameters**:
  - Training steps: 20,000 (matches LeRobot standard)
  - Batch size: 64
  - Learning rate: 1e-4
  - Weight decay: 1e-6
  - Gradient clipping: max_norm=1.0

#### 1.4 PushT Environment (`src/cupid/evaluation.py`)
- **Status**: ✅ Accurate Implementation
- **Specifications**:
  - Workspace bounds: [0, 512] (matches LeRobot)
  - Success threshold: 95% coverage
  - Coverage-based reward calculation
  - Realistic physics simulation with friction (0.95) and momentum

## 2. Comparison with LeRobot Standards

### 2.1 Similarities
- Training duration and hyperparameters align with LeRobot defaults
- PushT environment specifications match (workspace size, success criteria)
- Diffusion policy architecture follows standard practices
- Dataset structure uses HuggingFace format

### 2.2 Key Differences
| Aspect | CUPID Implementation | LeRobot Standard |
|--------|---------------------|------------------|
| Observations | State-based (2D positions) | Image-based (96x96 RGB) |
| Feature Extraction | Direct state input | CNN + SpatialSoftmax |
| Dataset Format | Custom wrapper | LeRobotDataset |
| Environment | Custom simulator | gym-pusht |

## 3. CUPID-Specific Features

### 3.1 Influence Score Computation
- Computes influence at trajectory level (not individual steps)
- Selection ratio: 33% (configurable, default based on paper)
- Efficient implementation with batched gradient computation
- Proper handling of performance gradient via rollouts

### 3.2 Demonstration Selection
- Sorts trajectories by influence score
- Selects top-k demonstrations
- Maintains min/max selection constraints
- Provides influence statistics (mean, std, percentiles)

## 4. Verification Results

### 4.1 Algorithm Correctness ✅
- Influence function formula matches CUPID paper exactly
- Diffusion policy implementation follows established patterns
- Training loop handles trajectory-based data correctly

### 4.2 Performance Considerations ✅
- Memory-efficient diagonal Hessian approximation
- Batch processing for influence computation
- Device fallback support (CUDA/MPS/CPU)

### 4.3 Numerical Stability ✅
- Appropriate damping in Hessian computation
- Gradient clipping during training
- Proper handling of edge cases (NaN/Inf checks)

## 5. Recommendations

### 5.1 For Production Use
1. **Add Image Support** (if needed):
   ```python
   # In policy.py, add CNN backbone
   self.vision_encoder = nn.Sequential(
       torchvision.models.resnet18(pretrained=True),
       SpatialSoftmax(num_keypoints=32)
   )
   ```

2. **Enhance Logging**:
   - Log influence score distributions
   - Track selection statistics over time
   - Monitor gradient norms during influence computation

3. **Experiment with Selection Ratios**:
   - Test 25%, 33%, 40% selection ratios
   - Compare performance vs training time trade-offs

### 5.2 For Research Extensions
1. **Alternative Influence Approximations**:
   - Test different Hessian approximation methods
   - Experiment with influence computation frequency

2. **Multi-task Support**:
   - Extend to other LeRobot tasks (ALOHA, etc.)
   - Compare influence patterns across tasks

3. **Online Selection**:
   - Implement incremental influence updates
   - Dynamic selection during training

## 6. Conclusion

The CUPID implementation is **well-designed and correctly implemented**. It successfully combines:
- Accurate influence function computation from the CUPID paper
- Standard diffusion policy architecture
- Proper PushT task implementation

The main architectural choice of using state-based rather than image-based observations simplifies the implementation while maintaining algorithmic correctness. This makes it an excellent foundation for:
- Demonstrating CUPID's effectiveness
- Extending to image-based tasks
- Comparing with full-data baselines

The code quality is high, with proper error handling, device management, and configurable parameters throughout.
